## 3rd Year Mini-Project SEM-5
### Abstract:
In recent years, Significant advancements in Science and Technology have paved the way for 
the emergence of hand gesture recognition technology and its diverse applications. This 
innovative technology has rapidly established itself as a powerful asset in the ongoing battle 
against the transmission of infectious diseases, with the potential to mitigate the impact of 
future pandemics that could affect various industries, including banking. 
Within the framework of our research, we present a groundbreaking model designed to harness 
the capabilities of touchless ATM machines, thereby providing a secure and seamless financial 
services experience. Our approach introduces a novel use of ATM cameras for hand tracing 
and detection, employing a sophisticated computer vision model to precisely analyze the 
intricate motions of an individual's hand. This process serves the dual purpose of identity 
validation in real-time and the reduction of physical contact, thus not only revolutionizing 
banking practices but also making substantial contributions to public health measures in the 
midst of pandemics and beyond
